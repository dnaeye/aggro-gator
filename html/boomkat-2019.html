<table width=1280px class="center"><col style = "width:5%"><col style = "width:5%"><col style = "width:15%"><col style = "width:50%"><col style = "width:25%"><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Artist</th><th>Album</th><th>Review</th><th>Play Album</th></tr></thead><tr><td>1</td><td>Kali Malone</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/the-sacrificial-code' target='_blank'>The Sacrificial Code</a></td><td>Our album of the year 2019 is Kali Malone’s 'The Sacrificial Code’ -  a major work featuring almost two hours of concentrated, creeping organ pieces. 'The Sacrificial Code' provided us with precious mental refuge just as the world started to spin out of control around us. It's an album that somehow slowed everything down, allowing us to take notice of every slight movement, as if every minute shift in sound became magnified through stillness.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3uZXkg8c5Ibsvuz1ZSpeSD" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Jim O'Rourke</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/to-magnetize-money-and-catch-a-roving-eye' target='_blank'>To Magnetize Money And Catch A Roving Eye</a></td><td>Sonic shapeshifter Jim O’Rourke yields 4 hours of engrossing, kaleidoscopic recordings from the Steamroom circa 2017-2018 in one of his most significant outings for years. Bringing everyone up to date with O’Rourke’s actions out in Japan, where he’s been stationed for a good few years, ‘to magnetize money and catch a roving eye’ operates under a title as curiously evocative as the music within.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The Caretaker</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/everywhere-at-the-end-of-time-stage-6' target='_blank'>Everywhere At The End Of Time - Stage 6</a></td><td>Earlier this year The Caretaker provided closure to a 20 year-long act that has uncannily lurked in the shadows of so many of our listening lives.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Angel Bat Dawid</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/the-oracle-197c5e97-a755-42b8-9d44-2632c42b39a6' target='_blank'>The Oracle</a></td><td>Angel Bat Dawid is an enigma; her debut album 'The Oracle’ (released earlier this year on tape) is a total anomaly. Dawid recorded, overdubbed and mixed the album on her own after a brain tumor diagnosis disrupted her music studies, she plays every instrument you hear (except for some drums), appears on the cover and produced every flawless twist and turn you’ll find inside.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4kZN7ATceKiek6dJS0I15M" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Morton Feldman</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/morton-feldman-piano' target='_blank'>Morton Feldman Piano</a></td><td>‘Morton Feldman Piano’ is a major 5CD collection of virtually all of Feldman’s music for piano, performed by Philip Thomas with a tactility befitting of this extraordinary, quiet, intimate music. It’s the most extensive survey of Feldman’s piano music since John Tilbury’s long unavailable 4-CD set was released 20 years ago, including several pieces which weren’t included there, and three works which have never been released on disc before at all.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2i4d6fTKwIEDeHw3ofBjv5" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1127</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/tqaseem-mqamat-el-haram-2016-2019' target='_blank'>Tqaseem Mqamat El Haram 2016-2019</a></td><td>The unmissable, head-twisting debut LP by Cairo's 1127 returns on a special one-off clear vinyl pressing for those who missed its shockwaves for the first time back in summer 2019, now including a bonus tape of previously unreleased, utterly crushing material from his 2016-2019 archive.

Remarkably conceived, recorded and released in 2019 - the same year they first met - ‘Sing as the Crow Flies’ is a super-natural meeting of mutual souls seeking to limn a sort of deep topographical reading of their home turf in a series of haunting, near-wordless hymns.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2syXTIrO5CJD1mpQG49uVk" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Kim Gordon</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/no-home-record' target='_blank'>No Home Record</a></td><td>Brilliantly loose-limbed, inspirational solo debut album from Kim Gordon after four decades fronting myriad projects, most notably Sonic Youth, but also with numerous collaborators including Tony Conrad, Ikue Mori, Julie Cafritz, Stephen Malkmus and most recently with Bill Nace as one half of Body/Head.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6HSBWnhRiJ3jZulqAmyim7" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Klein</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/lifetime-3ca1a574-38c1-4dea-b259-90657947b6a2' target='_blank'>Lifetime</a></td><td>‘Lifetime’ is the debut album proper by visionary collagist/producer/vocalist Klein, following from 2016’s head-spinning introduction made with ‘Only’. Recorded by Klein over the past 18 months and issued on her own label, inj inc., the album renders her mosaic of ideas taken from Gospel composer James Cleveland to film pioneer Spencer Williams and 18th C. tonalities in dreamlike 3D, and elevates her form of abstract, contemporary spirituality to quietly jaw-slapping degrees.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6vZszIMZ7Spzca3C7QSgaY" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>12</td><td>...</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/no-title-04aeabc2-a97d-4e85-a75f-a84a4cc215b4' target='_blank'>No Title</a></td><td>Sähkö are keeping schtum about this ace enigma from “an experimental artist willing to stay anonymous on this project”, although they do mention a likeness to Nurse With Wound, Hafler Trio, Zoviet*France… Presented under the low key moniker, …, ‘No Title’ sounds like a night in an abandoned wooden cabin in the arctic circle with CM Von Hausswolff, and only a reel to reel and a broken radio for company.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5qPZrSLh2oecfujdUZqgmy" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Jessica Pratt</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/quiet-signs' target='_blank'>Quiet Signs</a></td><td>Jessica Pratt’s exceedingly strange, seemingly sped up but ultimately completely immersive vocals are in haunting/beguiling effect on her 3rd album following an eponymous 2012 debut and ‘On Your Own Love Again’ [Drag City, 2015]. You’re either going to think the engineer is taking the piss or you’ll fall heavy under her spell - count us firnly under the latter....</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/00oz3t7cI3WfwS2oEIZD6x" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Wojciech Rusin</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/the-funnel-ea0ba389-4dd3-4233-b30e-a35013bd21cf' target='_blank'>The Funnel</a></td><td>An amazing slab from Glasgow’s fecund subterrain, ‘The Funnel’ is Wojciech Rusin’s debut razz of field recordings and choral composition riddled with rug-pulling edits and keeling turns of phrases - arguably a spiritual parallel to László Hortobágyi, Black Zone Myth Chant, Jani Christou, Él-G A big clue to the cryptic chicanery of ‘The Funnel’ is the fact that Wojciech Rusin builds his own instruments, which accounts for some degree of the odd tonalities at work.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Leila Bordreuil</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/headflush' target='_blank'>Headflush</a></td><td>The label behind Dominique Lawalree’s much-adored compilation pick out a real abstract beauty by cellist Leila Bordreuil for their 4th release, coming off like some dream meeting of Anne Guthrie and Kevin Drumm as overseen by Eliane Radigue.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6OsI5ZkpP1IVCe1qUhAbQj" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Carla Dal Forno</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/look-up-sharp' target='_blank'>Look Up Sharp</a></td><td>Carla dal Forno’s keenly anticipated 2nd album pays dividends on the promise of her debut, returning a gorgeous, stately suite of chamber pop that certifies her among the most vital songwriters in her field. Tipped to fans of Nico, HTRK, CS + Kreme, Dome, Julee Cruise... Forming an exquisitely pruned bouquet of midnight wildflowers, ‘Look Up Sharp’ makes the shrugging pop of Carla’s debut LP ‘You Know What It’s Like’ [2016] feel almost naif by comparison.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1oGsfPf2MzsctniqNsDZFy" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>17</td><td>H-Fusion</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/captured-entities' target='_blank'>Captured Entities</a></td><td>Cult Detroit DJ/producer Howard Thomas aka H-Fusion supplies a crackshot debut album of psycho-jit-jazz and rugged raw house on The Death of Rave following his secret weapon 12”s and trax for Sound Signature, Transmat and Fit between 2005-2012.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4H3qozpwEplrNuCRvhkVAi" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Bill Callahan</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/shepherd-in-a-sheepskin-vest' target='_blank'>Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest</a></td><td>It’s been 20 years since we heard Smog’s ’Spanish Moss’ for the first time and every Bill Callahan record since has f#cked us up. This is his first new one in years and is quite possibly his best. Supremely beautiful music... "As you listen to ‘Shepherd In A Sheepskin Vest’, a feeling of totality, of completeness, steals over you, like a thief in broad daylight. Of course it does - you’re listening to a new Bill Callahan record.

A masterful debut album informed by African Cosmology and Congolese rhythms, it’s aesthetically comparable with music ranging from Autechre's ‘Incunabula’ to The Connection Machine’s ‘Painless’ and Lee Gamble's hyperprisms, but ultimately it’s peerless in the (hyper)modern field...</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0PIVTG2gpP4lLUOYFRdKoe" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Dj Nigga Fox</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/cartas-na-manga' target='_blank'>Cartas Na Manga</a></td><td>DJ Nigga Fox’s most substantial release to date sets a new benchmark for Lisbon’s revered underground ghetto dance scene, pulling traces of jazz, acid house and cinematic sound design into his deeply rugged and exceptional sound with effortless style...</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0y9VSxO8IKtORmWHLtiMcX" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Andy Stott</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/it-should-be-us' target='_blank'>It Should Be Us</a></td><td>Andy Stott’s first release since 2016 and first EP since 2011, ‘It Should Be Us’ is a double EP of slow and raw productions for the club, recorded this year and following on from a series of EP’s that started with ‘Passed Me By’ and ‘We Stay Together’ early this decade.  Recorded fast and loose over the summer, these 9 tracks (8 on the vinyl) harness a pure and bare-boned energy, melodies subsumed by drum machines and synths; slow, rugged abandon.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2b4RNCznna9U13uXza9jdl" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Girl Band</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/the-talkies' target='_blank'>The Talkies</a></td><td>One of the most inventive, well produced, original and hard-hitting records of the year. There are echoes of The Fall, Can and Sonic Youth but wrapped in something new. F#cking bravo. “In many ways the idea behind the album was to make an audio representation of the house.” And this enigmatic manor becomes Girl Band’s sonic playground: to place yourself within a space and to work with that space harmoniously.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4HEm06MXeU971JnvRPstSw" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Sarah Davachi</td><td><a href='https://boomkat.com/products/pale-bloom' target='_blank'>Pale Bloom</a></td><td>Sarah Davachi’s ‘Pale Bloom’ sees the preternaturally gifted composer return to her first instrument, the piano, with ineffably graceful results that incorporate vocals to spine-chilling effect.
