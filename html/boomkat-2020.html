Roughly once a decade since 2000 the pioneering Afrofuturist has offered a new landmark of deep, electronic music, and ‘From the Far Future, Pt. 3’ stakes one of 2020’s - and probably the next decade’s - leading examples of Detroit techno at its furthest, most experimental limits.</td>

In step with the more polished production advances of their label mates, Lisbon’s DJ Kolt, DJ Noronha, and DJ Perigoso - aka Blacksea Não Maya - arrive 5 years on from their previous showing with a remarkably darker, muscular take on mutated Angolan dance music.</td>

Practically pocket-sized in comparison to their sprawling torrent of live material and radio recordings in recent years, ’Sign’ is a return to the sort of concision found circa ‘Exai’ and their earlier albums.</td>

The songs are sad and graceful, slow and seductive, simple and enjoyable. Callahan's a witty, gifted songwriter and his take on deeply Americanized country and folk tropes is never dull.</td>
