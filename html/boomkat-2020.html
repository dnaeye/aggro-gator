Total mind-melter this one, easily Python’s best material since his 'Dulce Compañia’ debut - we can tell you now we’re gonna be banging on about this record all fucking year.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2RLMab2R3icqnFA2dYJKVc" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Beatrice Dillon</td><td>Workaround</td><td>‘Workaround’ is the singular debut album proper by Beatrice Dillon; an eminent rhythm fiend whose productions and DJ sets are prized for her patient, fluid grasp of space, texture and devilish, syncopated UK club styles.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1kGLxIjski3cSPhXBJRnw9" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Nazar</td><td>Guerrilla</td><td>One of the strongest debut albums we've heard in years, Nazar’s ‘Guerrilla’ is a record about the Angolan civil war that we reckon will come to be one of the defining albums of 2020 Relaying the tragedy and terror of his family’s experience of war, Nazar uses a highly distinctive sound design palette and manacled grasp of what he calls “rough kuduro” rhythms to bring listeners deep into his mindset.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3KEgoCxUb76KMU2I2iuHS4" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Cindy Lee</td><td>What's Tonight To Eternity</td><td>Very strong slab of haunted ‘60s pop themes and keeling synth noise from Canada’s Pat Flegel aka Cindy Lee, formerly of Canadian indie-pop heroes Women, now sounding like a spell concocted by Panda Bear, Forest Swords, Johnny Jewel and Dean Hurley’s Trouble. Check the samples and trust your ears, it’s a bewt! “For Patrick Flegel, Cindy Lee is more than just a recording music project.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5BEV4gGnAkRsLuoW3FQeqN" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Lea Bertucci</td><td>Acoustic Shadows</td><td>Properly engrossing and cataclysmic widescreen recordings of brass and percussion booming around a bridge in Köln on this wonder from NYC composer/sound designer Lea Bertucci for London’s emergent experimental music platform, SA Recordings. It sounds like a panoramic blade-runneresque fantasy, one of the most satisfying experimental records we've heard in a long time - huge recommendation.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1JAfmHjEZx3L2yUztNwkFM" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Nídia</td><td>Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes</td><td>One of 2020’s most distinctive new dance and electronic soul LPs, ‘Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes’ sees Kuduro auteur Nídia come into her own with a strikingly fresh, deep and original showcase of Afro-Portuguese dance music.

Duma win 2020. Breathtaking by any measure, Kenyan grindcore band Duma’s unparalleled debut of blast beats, sky-clawing synth noise and scarred larynx vocals is one of the mightiest things you’ll hear all year - a huge RIYL Nkisi, Woid, Senyawa...</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1jEsVcciMGOYLx0gj1Y3oQ" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Cs + Kreme</td><td>Snoopy</td><td>An absolute treasure of an album, CS + Kreme’s debut is an early contender for 2020’s best - a quietly seductive, deeply romantic and stealthily addictive long player in the most classic, enduring sense.  ’Snoopy’ has got under our skin with its opiated elegance and spellbinding hooks over the precious few months we’ve had the pleasure of spending in its company.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3vhFXo3OHKZ9AVFxfJqdzc" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Various Artists</td><td>Documenting Sound Series</td><td>No review available</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Lucy Liyou</td><td>Welfare</td><td>Dead uncanny new music from Lucy Liyou, a Philadelphia-based ambient/collage artist creating absorbing musical stories based on Korean folk-opera and “nuances in Quotidian experience” - think Nozomu Matsumoto meets Klein at Arca’s gaff and you’ve nearly got a grasp on this one.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0PGDj4gxyNRo27oV1vKPhd" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Fuji||||||||||Ta</td><td>iki</td><td>As we approach the end of 2020, we thought we'd shine a light on a handful of releases we reckon should have had a bit more attention; albums that might have fallen between the cracks for some of you, but which have become missing links between different scenes and feelings for us over the duration of this cursed year. First up is FUJI||||||||||TA, whose iki album offered solace and space for contemplation with one of the most unusual, moving recordings we’ve heard in recent years.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1IXNjB6zuKsLTDhjyfQEyW" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Mica Levi</td><td>Ruff Dog</td><td>Has Mica Levi ever made a bad record? This, again, shifts the template to a sort of scuzzed dreampop somewhere between MBV and that Chopped & Screwed hookup with the London Sinfonietta that really is one of our favourite records of all time. Has Mica Levi ever made a bad record? Nah.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1e8PvuiK4lZLOdeZkE1mqR" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Terrence Dixon</td><td>From the Far Future, Pt. 3</td><td>Detroit visionary Terrence Dixon scans stellar new horizons on the awe-inspiring 3rd chapter of his most cherished, foundational and inspiring album series. Roughly once a decade since 2000 the pioneering Afrofuturist has offered a new landmark of deep, electronic music, and ‘From the Far Future, Pt. 3’ stakes one of 2020’s - and probably the next decade’s - leading examples of Detroit techno at its furthest, most experimental limits.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3j7N1bnqSZojYpVa1iUlXU" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Michael J. Blood</td><td>Introducing Michael J. Blood</td><td>For our money, an everlasting classic - one that finally made it to wax at more or less exactly the moment clubs were shuttered earlier this year.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Hanne Lippard</td><td>Work</td><td>This is a brilliantly weird and hypnotic record, featuring pretty much nothing but the voice of conceptual artist Hanne Lippard reading a variety of texts typical of our digital age - things like autoresponders, FAQ’s, social media posts, bot-generated spam mail etc (or as she calls it ‘degenerate, or “b-language”) as a continuation of her ongoing investigation of the differences between the spoken and the written word.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2AyTEVVEW0e1mR6SDDkJzC" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Bill Nace</td><td>Both</td><td>Killer, beautifully scorched noise guitar and amp séances for the connoisseurs right here from improv catalyst Bill Nace (Body/Head) at his most crudely tactile and feverishly slow-burning.

It’s part collage, part audio diary, part reflection; a sort of private ritual purification that comes highly recommended if you’re into works by Mark Gergis, Philip Corner, Mark Leckey and Hildegard Westerkamp.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/67WZCZhqrzUIOMeyRfhkjy" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Beatriz Ferreyra</td><td>Echos+</td><td>After a standout Recollections GRM side in 2015, Argentina’s Beatriz Ferreyra places over half a century of avant-garde knowledge and practice at the service of an utterly enchanting new collection for Room40, ranging from elegiac vocal works to apocalyptic concrète composition...</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/23KJGuLEVnK3eu3o8wFFRX" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Hilary Woods</td><td>Birthmarks</td><td>Gorgeous sophomore LP of gothic folk from Hilary Woods, aka erstwhile bassist with JJ72. Really strong Lynchian vibes on this one - aided by exceptionally dank and creaking production by Lasse Marhaug.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/12bknz7HRg0QW7aNH0UnyH" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Pretty Sneaky</td><td>Pretty Sneaky LP</td><td>This lot have released 5 x 12”s anonymously over the last 3 years via Hardwax and there’s no info about them anywhere, pretty sneaky. They now land on Mana, a label so esoteric it has a flowchart on its website showing you how to get from Luc Ferrari to Nico Jaar in one short leap. There are 4 long tracks, one per side, each clocking in at 15 mins and each taking time to expand into being.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Spivak</td><td>Μετά Το Ρέιβ</td><td>Gorgeous debut LP by Maria Spivak, a rawly expressive set of atmospheric, night-time synth-pop romancers channelling mystic vibes from Lena Platonos to HTRK and The Other People Place - very special stuff, indeed.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Wayne Phoenix</td><td>soaring wayne phoenix story the earth</td><td>An enigma this one, the debut release - a decade in the making - from an artist about which we know very little. It’s a mysterious, confessional beauty -  a diaristic mix of half-cut songs and textured, bittersweet electronic collage that we urge you to check if you’re into anything from Klein to Burial, Tricky to Mica Levi, Young Echo to RZA’s Ghost Dog OST.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2rgA2KTg7lQkxGn5OyxH9O" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Mark Fell And Will Guthrie</td><td>Infoldings / Diffractions</td><td>Released as two separate vinyl LP’s, Mark Fell & Will Guthrie’s Infoldings / Diffractions is now also available as one combined digital edition, released via  Koshiro Hino’s (Goat, YPY) newly minted NAKID label. Informed/inspired by Gamelan and South Indian Carnatic musics, this set comes with a big recommendation if you’re into Autechre, Michael Ranta, The Necks, Milford Graves.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Peter Zinovieff & Lucy Railton</td><td>RFG Inventions for Cello and Computer</td><td>Remarkable collaboration between inventor, synth pioneer and EMS co-founder Peter Zinovieff and preeminent cellist Lucy Railton, capturing a life-altering dialogue between two figures with a more than 50-year age gap between them, and with very little shared musical vocabulary.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5DWW0xZx781806iLflAxsg" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Ulla</td><td>Tumbling Towards A Wall</td><td>Immersively sensual, diaristic entries by cult US ambient avatar Ulla (aka Ulla Straus), the first release on Experiences Ltd, a new label run by Special Guest DJ (uon, Caveman Paradise), and a big recommendation if yr feeling Huerco S, Nadia Khan, Dominique Lawalrée, Ryuichi Sakamoto.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4typKG5HG3aKrZTcTUs5gR" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Oï Les Ox</td><td>Crooner qui coule sous les clous</td><td>Unreal début from French musician, artist, writer and dramaturge, Oï les Ox; basically one of the craftiest albums we’ve heard all of this damned 2020 - riddled with melodic ohrwurms - a massive RIYL Trevor Duncan’s La Jetée soundtrack to the most enigmatic oddities from Broadcast to Julia Holter, Teresa Winter to Nozomu Matsumoto and Rian Treanor’s disruptive rhythms.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6CGX44pUTCf0oW6tD1qa1t" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>29</td><td>The Necks</td><td>Three</td><td>Breathtaking new studio album from The Necks, saddling up for a glorious route taking in fast flowing polyrhythms and revelatory soundscapes - really one of their strongest in a flawless catalogue that now spans 30 years and with a closing track that once again taps into that Talk Talk thing they do so well...</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2qWLFav8tDhDt2NyNOjAb0" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>30</td><td>Sockethead</td><td>Harj-o-Marj</td><td>Outta-nowhere DIY blinder from YOUTH; the sprawling debut album by Manchester-based painter, artist, DJ/producer Richard Harris aka Sockethead, recorded in a caravan on the Scottish West Coast and sweeping from fractal jungle to outsider folk and bruised, squashed soul music, think something like John Bender via Actress and into a Jandek/Robert Wyatt jam, highly recommended if u were feeling similarly singular Northwest tangents from FUMU, Turinn, G.H.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2sXOI88zDuiC8TjaN2oJbB" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Senyawa & Stephen O’Malley</td><td>Bima Sakti</td><td>Ancient Indonesian tradition meets doom metal in profoundly Ur ways on Stephen O’Malley and Senyawa’s collaborative commission for choreographer Gisèle Vienne, highly recommended if you’re into Sunn O))), Keiji Haino, Nazoranai, Phurpa, KTL.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3FrSClH1DbmZx8hiZtY99I" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Laila Sakini</td><td>Into the Traffic, Under the Moonlight</td><td>'Into the Traffic, Under the Moonlight’ is a new set of songs woven from the same fibre as Laila Sakini’s stunning ‘Vivienne’ album - one of the records we listened to - and loved - most this year, expanding its minimalist palette of piano, voice and effects to include some percusive samples, cello, bass clarinet, flute and hand claps.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>33</td><td>Eiko Ishibashi</td><td>Hyakki Yagyo</td><td>A new solo album by Eiko Ishibashi, following on from the duo recording Ichida alongside bassist Darin Gray. Hyakki Yagyō (Night Parade of One Hundred Demons) was produced for the ‘Japan Supernatural’ exhibition at The Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney focusing on ghost stories and folklore from the Edo period onwards.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>34</td><td>U</td><td>Lowlands</td><td>This one was pressed up in such a small run back at the start of the year that barely anybody caught sight of it, which is a shame cos it’s a deadly little thing. It starts off in the vicinity of Carl Craig’s Psyche/BFC classics and ends on a sorta woozy sea-shanty somewhere between Laurie Anderson's ‘O Superman’ and This Mortal Coil’s Song To The Siren. Basically, the best all-over-the-place vibes. ‘Lowlands’ thrills with a broad and fully formed mix of styles that’s impossible to pin down.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7bFDQofoYlLNFV7PS0NpGV" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>35</td><td>Ewa Justka</td><td>Upside Down Smile</td><td>Knockout punch of computer music noise and hardcore techno razz from Ewa Justka, a catalytic figure on the live algorithmic coding circuit. Like the gleefully evil sister of EVOL, instrument builder and producer Ewa Justka has brilliantly and belligerently pushed the saltiest brand of sound and rhetoric for half a decade since releasing one of the earliest numbers on Calum Gunn’s Conditional in 216.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4c433BcnpynSDYAbxPHoou" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>36</td><td>Ben Bertrand</td><td>Manes</td><td>Exquisite bass clarinet nocturnes from Belgium, recorded in 2019 but feasibly coming from any point over the last 40 years - another boutique waffle off the Stroom griddle. Comparisons between bass clarinet-favouring Ben Bertrand and Colin Stetson are perhaps inevitable, but where the Canadian often goes macho, Brussels-based Bertrand is ineffably cooler, and better considered along with sax player Alex Zhang Hungtai’s knack for huffably intoxicating atmospheres.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1Sz78fkGkOhgspkhYMwdeC" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>37</td><td>Golem Mecanique</td><td>Nona, Decima et Morta</td><td>Staggering avant-folk hymns by France’s Karen Jebane aka Golem Mecanique, eliding haunting vocals with billowing hurdy-gurdy-like tones from a rare French instrument. She takes all the time she needs to cast two spellbinding durational works full of visceral, slow-burning and dissonant energy. Hand-picked for release on Stephen O’Malley’s Ideologic Organ, you can trust this one’s as vital and heavy as your life, as he explains below.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3o6a5n7rzzi1aTASuu8FJb" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Lyra Pramuk</td><td>Fountain</td><td>Operatic ambient-pop meets contemporary classical in strikingly distinguished form - imagine Julianna Barwick duetting with Antony Hegarty at Holly Herndon’s lab and you’re not far off this singular bouquet. “Lyra Pramuk’s debut Fountain explores a post-human, non-binary understanding of life. Lyra Pramuk fuses classical training, pop sensibilities, performance practices and contemporary club culture in what may best be described as futurist folk music.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1wL3qXTeiRKUhEJM1tOf5q" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>39</td><td>Okkyung Lee</td><td>Yeo-Neun</td><td>Ravishing, dream-like debut by Okkyung Lee’s chamber ensemble, placing a rarely paralleled instrumental guile and imagination at the service of Shelter Press’ beautiful series of carefully hand-picked editions.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0udIpMQFfhwGZIa0In5OJo" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>40</td><td>Jim O'Rourke</td><td>Shutting Down Here</td><td>Recorded at INA GRM and Steamroom, covering a period of thirty years, the gap between the two visits Jim O'Rourke made to the GRM, featuring Eiko Ishibashi on piano, Atsuko Hatano on violin and viola and Eivind Lonning on trumpet .  "Shutting Down Here" is an exceptional recording, commencing GRM's brand new series of releases "Portraits GRM" and covering 30 years of activity from Jim O'Rourke.</td><td>Not available</td><tr><tr><td>41</td><td>Jon Collin & Demdike Stare</td><td>Sketches Of Everything</td><td>Ostensibly Demdike Stare's first proper full-length collaboration, 'Sketches Of Everything' weaves dark moorland ambient blues into guitarist Jon Collin’s windswept Americana. It's a highly evocative swing between porchside strums, sludge doom and weathered dub noise somewhere between Bruce Langhorne’s soundtrack for ‘The Hired Hand’, Neil Young's 'Dead Man', Loren Mazzacane Connors at his most swoonsome and a screwed Prince Jazzbo - proper stoner vistas.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6Cx6z0dtSzqBXPbvvd4VVA" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>42</td><td>Phelimuncasi</td><td>2013-2019</td><td>Crucial selection of raw, darkside early gqom from pioneering Durban trio Phelimuncasi, setting the gripping vocals of twins Makan Nana and Khera, and Malathon, to cranky technoid club engines by DJ Menzi, DJ Mp3, and DJ Scoturn, all showcased for first time outside South Africa on the ever vital Nyege Nyege Tapes. Unmissable for fans of dark, heavy dance music of all stripes!</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6nV5C6SUH5ohU2EoEtwL6w" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>43</td><td>1995 Epilepsy</td><td>1995 epilepsy</td><td>Killlller avant-’95 jungle rolige, noise and ruffneck club rudeness from some unknown entity on the label that's sometimes home to Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland. We haven’t a chuffing clue who’s behind this lot, but it sounds to our ears like Mica Levi, Andy Stott and Lolina bunkered down for a night with some research chemicals and watched loads of mid ‘90s rave videos in the studio.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/25Zs1eQrDXBgEkAUiaKLeQ" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>44</td><td>Ann Margaret Hogan</td><td>Honeysuckle Burials</td><td>Stunning album from Ann Margaret Hogan aka Annie Hogan - prolific collaborator with the likes of everyone from Nick Cave to Simon Fisher Turner’s Deux Filles, Kraftwerk’s Wolfgang Flur, Lydia Lunch and countless others - here resurfacing on Karl O’Connor’s Downwards label, of all places, for a gorgeous swirl of reflective solo piano and field recordings that somehow reminds us of Virginia Astley’s life changing early 80’s masterpiece ‘From Gardens Where We Feel Secure’ - one of our favourite</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4egIxjN3ZtsyKo2N3ZK20f" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>45</td><td>David Toop</td><td>Field Recording and Fox Spirits</td><td>Master field recordist, author and sound theorist David Toop presents a poignant, deeply trippy tableaux inspired by Chinese ghost stories and including recordings of his grandpa’s memories of 1901, a blind street group in Chiang Mai, and Ornette Coleman in conversation - wonderfully transitory, metaphysical stuff of rare substance. From David Toop: What are field recordings?</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0reHMpeumN1KcWsAhevCRi" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>46</td><td>Eyvind Kang</td><td>Ajaeng Ajaeng</td><td>One of the most prolific and gifted composers for strings of his generation, Eyvind Kang returns to Ideologic Organ with sublime experimental classical fusions of Eastern and Western traditions. Leading on from last year’s ‘Chirality’, Kang cuts a more minimalist figure on ‘Ajaeng Ajaeng’ with a quietly spellbinding elision of the Sitar-like Indian Tanpura with Korean Ajaeng and their European cousin the Harpsichord.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1azGAKMD3gEHj6uQuFpeZG" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>47</td><td>Shinichi Atobe</td><td>Yes</td><td>Shinichi Atobe’s fifth album for DDS, his first in two years. Deep and sublime, the classic Chain Reaction < > Chicago House vibe, but this time with a swarming Drexciyan undercurrent, somewhere between DJ Sprinkles, Dopplereffekt and The Other People Place, and yet still 100% Shinichi. It’s odd working with an artist without ongoing dialogue; no context or an exchange of ideas. It’s all conjecture.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7zsktVl91eHbxy2cEoUfZ3" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>48</td><td>Sarah Davachi</td><td>Cantus, Descant</td><td>The new Sarah Davachi record is an 80 minute, 17 track double album meditation on impermanence and endings, framed by minimalistic organ études and careful harmonic layering. On two tracks the artist’s own vocals are also heard for the first time. This is the first release on the artist’s own label, Late Music.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6QQlw7AOPEaL3ot8V211cV" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Metal Preyers</td><td>Metal Preyers</td><td>Incredible album of ruffneck outernational soundsystem abstractions brought together by Uganda’s by-now infamously fecund Nyege Nyege crew; an impressionistic industrial/ambient soundtrack where chopped & screwed gristle meets ballistic singeli and mutant electro-acholi. If you’re into anything from King Midas Sound to classic Talking Heads, Nearly God and The WIld Bunch - this one’s a stone cold killer.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/56kHKqaQBAVgYWVunNH39k" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>50</td><td>Jasmine Inifiniti</td><td>BXTCH SLÄP</td><td>Brooklyn-based queer nightlife luminary Jasmine Infiniti self-released her debut album, BXTCH SLÄP, in March 2020. Dark Entries steps forward to present the album remastered and on double vinyl.  "Over the thirteen disruptive club cuts of BXTCH SLÄP, Jasmine conjures occult rave incantations with sub-tectonic bass and seductive harmonies.</td><td><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5ZQgUIk9rZc7JpbTqwpp2F" width="300" height="80" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></td><tr><tr><td>51</td><td>Valentina Magaletti & Marlene Ribeiro</td><td>Due Matte</td><td>Valentina Magaletti (Raime, Tomaga, Vanishing Twin) & Marlene Ribeiro (Gnod, Negra Blanca) venture their oneiric style of “tropical concrete” in a gently head-swilling duo following Horn of Plenty’s excellent Moniek Darge reissue.
