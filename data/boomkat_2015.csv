rank,artist,album,genre,review
1,Prurient,Frozen Niagara Falls,Electronic,"By Pitchfork's reckoning Dominick Fernow's discography now stands at over 150 releases long - so it isn't without much consideration that we say that 'Frozen Niagara Falls' is his defining, most exploratory and ultimately rewarding work to date."
2,Jlin,Dark Energy,Jungle / Footwork,"Jlin breaks thru the Chicago footwork ranks with one of the scene's most fascinating, essential mutations in 'Dark Energy', co-presented by Planet µ and Jamie Kuedo's very promising new Knives label. It's quite possibly the most distinctive contribution to footwork since the RP Boo album and Rashad's jungle splices, and, in such a fast-moving (quite literally) and active scene, that's gotta be saying something."
3,Mark Fell & Gábor Lázár,The Neurobiology of Moral Decision Making,Electronic,"Mark Fell and Gábor Lázár ratchet the game with their razor-sharp debut collaboration, 'The Neurobiology of Moral Decision Making'. If you're into Errorsmith, Lorenzo Senni, Autechre, Actress or SND; we'd say this one's as essential as they come. The duo have colluded on a set of ten tracks, ranging from short synapse bursts thru to an uncannily emotive 12 minute masterpiece on the closing side."
4,Oneohtrix Point Never,Garden of Delete,Electronic,"Oneohtrix Point Never strafes myriad hyperstitious structures and patterns in pursuit of a futurist nostalgia across 'Garden of Delete', his scudding, delirious 2nd album for Warp and 10th solo since 2007."
5,Theo Burt,Gloss,Electronic,"Originally written circa 2009/2010, Gloss is an album that was never really intended for public consumption but, thanks to Lorenzo Senni's efforts, is now presented here in all it's hugely individual glory."
6,Kara-Lis Coverdale & Lxv,Sirens,Electronic,'Sirens' is an utterly captivating side of alien ambient composition by Kara-Lis Coverdale and LXV (a.k.a. David Sutton) for Mexico City's quietly ace Umor Rex label.
7,Jenny Hval,"Apocalypse, girl",Indie / Alternative,"Norway's most precious, provocative pop export presents the barbed strokes of 'Apocalypse, Girl' - her 3rd album - with Brooklyn's Sacred Bones."
8,Stephen O'Malley,Gruidés,Modern Classical / Ambient,"Sunn O)))’s Stephen O’Malley delivers an incredible solo work for Demdike Stare’s DDS imprint, recorded together with French 35-piece improv orchestra ONCEIM. The dark interpreter, Stephen O'Malley ov Sunn 0))), presents his towering debut orchestral composition 'Guidés'; commissioned by French 35-piece improv orchestra ONCEIM - l'Orchestre de Nouvelles Créations, Expérimentations et Improvisation Musicales - and released thru Demdike Stare's DDS label."
9,Eleh / Tara Jane O'Neil,Split,Electronic,"In keeping with tradition (this time last year they dropped that insanely brilliant Else Marie Pade collection), Important drop one of the most quietly crucial albums of the year with this rich, rewarding split album from two of the label’s most notable artists: Eleh and Tara Jane O’Neil. Sound sculptures and gongs by Harry Bertoia unite both sides of the album."
10,Jefre Cantu-Ledesma,A Year with 13 Moons,Electronic,"Root Strata founder, Jefre Cantu-Ledesma scales supernal heights of dream-pop and shoegazing noise bliss with 'A Year With 13 Moons' for Mexican Summer. We'll get it out right now - this is easily Jefre's magnum opus; a consolidation of all that we already loved about the incendiary romance of his work, boosted by a renewed sense of wonder and a catalytic clash of pop pangs fighting against avant garde instincts."
11,Helm,Olympic Mess,Electronic,"Luke Younger's Helm undergoes a captivating metamorphosis from noise agitator to industrial ambient alchemist with 'Olympic Mess', his new album for PAN. Prompted by a period of personal turmoil and a chaotic lifestyle on the road playing support for Danish punks, Ice Age; Younger expands his sonic palette here with nods to the loop-based structures and textural sensuality of balearic disco, dub techno and industrial music."
12,Nídia Minaj,Danger,Grime / Fwd,"Fierce debut of f*cked and trippy ghetto funk from 18 year-old producer Nidia Minaj. Hailing from south of Lisbon via Bordeaux, Nidia is in possession of a genuinely astonishing and exciting sound, concisely crammed with levels of detail, colour and ruggedest dancefloor funk that make other, older producers seem boring by comparison."
13,Dialect,Gowanus Drifts,Electronic,"An emotionally raw suite of seamlessly arranged ambient electronics, 4th world instrumentals and sweeping synth music. Hands-down the best 1080p release to date. RIYL Elysia Crampton, Alessandro Cortini, T C F... ""“Ikea stores next to huge burnt out shipping warehouses, squats next to Whole Foods, Artisan flower shops with dead dogs outside. Litter on the breeze and foghorns blowing across the water."
14,Giovanni Di Domenico & Jim O'Rourke,Arco,Modern Classical / Ambient,Italy's ever-lucent Die Schachtel present a life-affirming longform composition for strings and electronics to inaugurate their Zeit Composers vinyl series.
15,F Ingers,Hide Before Dinner,Electronic,"Stone cold classic BEB material from the Aussie trio, Carla dal Forno (Tarcar), Samuel Karmel and Tarquin Manek (Tarcar, LST).  A frighteningly affective meditation on childhood memories, 'Hide Before Dinner' dredges similar, cobwebby partitions of the mind as Leyland Kirby's classics as The Caretaker, realising a drug fug sequence of enervated electronics, croaking death-folk and pause-button collage with an indelibly psychedelic impact."
16,M.E.S.H.,Piteous Gate,Electronic,"Janus crew's M.E.S.H. unpackages a vast internal world across the ornate topographies of his incredible debut album.  Combining scything club dynamics and Hollywood sound design with a sample bank of archaic renaissance instruments, 'Piteous Gate' describes a hyperreal place-out-of-time framed by matrices of tessellating grids and vapour-trace contours rent in near-VR detail."
17,Lst,Th Duo,Industrial / Wave / Electro,"Berlin's Another Dark Age label claim an idiosyncratic nether ground with LST's aleatoric enigma, 'Th Duo'. Staking a unique position just behind the ear, right at the back of your bonce, Melbourne's Tarquin Manek (a.k.a. half of BEB's Tarcar) quietly mines his very own ""lo-sci-fi"" style in this series of nine corrupted memory implants meshing frayed nerves and fragmented, extra-terrestrial frequencies."
18,Alessandro Cortini,Risveglio,Electronic,"Nine Inch Nails' synthesist, Alessandro Cortini, animates an enveloping shadowplay of Roland 202 and TB303 spectres in his second album for Hospital Productions following the stunning 'Forse' trilogy for Important Records.  'Risveglio' is the 'Awakening' to 'Sonno''s 'Sleep'."
19,Kode9,Nothing,Grime / Fwd,"Arch conceptualist and flash-fwd junglist Kode 9 commits a killer 1st solo LP to Hyperdub with 'Nøthing' following two landmark album collaborations with Stephen Samuel Gordon a.k.a. MC Space Ape, who died in 2014 after a prolonged battle with cancer. Far as we can tell, 'Nøthing' is essentially a treatise on existentialism in our surreal, cybernetic and near post-human age."
20,Teresa Winter,Oh Tina No Tina,Electronic,"Fractured, intra-dimensional raveries from a very promising new artist plucked out by Reckno - home to Kinlaw, Joane Skyler… Imagine what Maria Minerva might sound like had she been raised on jungle and gauzy IDM rather than '90s house, and you're within grasp of 'Oh Tina No Tina'."
21,Visionist,Safe,Grime / Fwd,"Grime accelerator and anterior electronic artist Louis Carnell a.k.a. Visionist recalibrates your aural retina with the laser-cut geometries of 'Safe', his debut album with PAN. Arriving soon after the launch of Visionist's PAN X Codes programme with Bill Kouligas, 'Safe' projects a discordant and fractured future haunted by the present's reverence of the past and frustrated by what he perceives as the scene's experimental immobility and short-sightedness."
22,Sunn O))),Kannon,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"Sunn 0))) rise again with the arch doom metal of Kannon, their crushing follow-up to respective 2014 collaborations with Scott Walker and Ulver, and the first Sunn 0))) LP proper since Monoliths & Dimensions in 2009. Aye, crack out the ales, it’s worthy of a celebration. By their own admissions, “It’s possibly the most figurative album Sunn 0))) has created” but, conversely, it’s also their “most outright “metal” in years”."
23,Kuedo,Assertion Of A Surrounding Presence,Electronic,"The prodigal son of sci-fi electronica re-enters orbit with an astounding new EP as Kuedo for his newly coined Knives imprint.  Arriving almost a decade to the day since his game-changing Vex'd album with Roly Porter, 'Assertion Of A Surrounding Presence' manifests his first major new work since 2011's acclaimed 'Severant' album, and also marks a lucent new pinnacle of sound design/engineering in his field."
24,Campbell Irvine,Reunion Of Two Bodies,Techno / House,"Exceptional take on techno tribalism from yung Australian producer, Campbell Irvine. Picking up where Shackleton left before he went psy-trance, Campbell runs with a proper dread techno vibe on two extended walkabouts strafed with duppied voices and urged by layered, syncopated percussion and deep subs. We're particularly feeling the scratchy swing and shuffle of B-side 'Reunion Of Two Bodies', which sits somewhere between Shacky, Demdike and Villalobos."
25,Ash Koosha,GUUD,Electronic,"Ash Koosha debuts with a shockingly fresh suite of electronics on the influential Olde English Spelling Bee imprint - strongly recommended to fans of Arca, Mica Levi, Lotic…  'Guud' is one of those kaleidoscopic visions that gets twisted out only very occasionally, rendering a lush spirit with a clear taste for keeling levels of bittersweet, gender-bending dissonance and microtonal tingle."
26,Colleen,Captain Of None,Modern Classical / Ambient,"Following on from an extended period of silence broken by 2013’s ""The Weighing of the Heart” album, Cécile Schott a.k.a. Colleen returns with the fantastic ""Captain Of None”, without question the finest record of her career to date."
27,Joanna Newsom,Divers,Indie / Alternative,"The dreamer dreams again with her 4th album of otherworldly microcosms, 'Divers', recorded by Steve Albini and featuring contributions by Nico Muhly and The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, arriving five years since her last opus for Drag City."
28,John T. Gast,Excerpts,Electronic,"Outstanding, otherworldly debut album proper by the Hype Williams collaborator known as Henny Moan and John T. Gast. An ambient enigma steeped in post-hypnagogic tristesse, 'Excerpts' is a cryptic hash of mutant dance music, lo-fi pop, and screwed lounge styles every bit as skewed and enigmatic as you might hope from someone who's worked so closely with Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland (he contributed to 'Black Is Beautiful' and 'The Redeemer' a.o.)."
29,Rabit,Communion,Grime / Fwd,"One of North America's keenest adopters and augmenters of UK grime tilts the game fwd with the exquisite sound designs of his debut album for Tri Angle.  If OPN made grime it may well sound something like 'Communion' - a fractured, strobing sequence of hyper-visual sonics serrating and eliding grime's structures to the aesthetics of modern electronic collage with the vision of a sci-fi novelist and precision of a Hollywood film editor."
30,Arca,Mutant,Electronic,"Alejandro Ghersi a.k.a. Arca reveals another, morphing aspect of his unique sound for Mute following roles production for Björk, Kanye, Kelela and FKA Twigs. From initial listens it sounds like he's heading farther into widescreen TCF territory than the dancefloor here; swapping implosive bass punch and  percussive dynamics for an elusively gyroscopic, mercurial sound sphere. Packaged in artwork by Jesse Kanda. Highly Recommended!"
31,Hypnotower,Unlearn,Electronic,"Ectoplasm Girl, Tanya Byrne, returns to iDEAL with the uncanny, ten-stage solo noise hypnosis of 'Unlearn'. Arriving a year on from her sister, Nadine Byrne's incredible 'A Different Gesture: Collected Soundtracks 2011-2012', this suite reprises the repetitive trance states of their 'TxN' album, but at an enervated, slower pace and with more atonal, abstract textures in pursuit of some deeply personal, powerful and psychedelic spirit."
32,Julia Holter,Have You In My Wilderness,Indie / Alternative,Julia Holter's transcendent pop music reaches heavenly levels in her sophomore Domino album after a brace of gush-worthy sides.
33,Black Zone Myth Chant,Mane Thecel Phares,Jungle / Footwork,"Exceptional slab of squashed, Afro-centric psychedelia and hypnotic Footwork from Low Jack’s Editions Gravats label Low Jack and Jean Carval’s Gravats label open 2015 with a killer new album from prolific psych-drone artist High Wolf under his Black Zone Myth Chant alias. ‘Mane Thecel Phares’ is a wigged-out trip thru Afro-centric, riddim-driven psychedelia, breaking down the boundaries between Sun Ra, DJ Screw, and Vox Populi!"
34,Russell Haswell,As Sure As Night Follows Day,Electronic,"Diagonal mascot Russell Haswell returns to the burgeoning label with his most accessible - and vitally danceable - tech-n0!se attack after exercising the daemons in 2014's critically acclaimed '37 Minute Workout' LP. Practically bursting at the seams with destructive energy, 'As Sure As Night Follows Day' can be viewed as a flashback to 30 years of aktion at the coal face of extreme/ electronic music."
35,Rupert Clervaux & Beatrice Dillon,Studies I-XVII For Samplers And Percussion,Electronic,"Techno goes Folkways in Studies I-XVII for Samplers and Percussion; the superb collection of rhythmelodic exercise by London-based artists, Rupert Clervaux and Beatrice Dillon."
36,J.G. Biberkopf,Ecologies,Electronic,"Kuedo and Joe Shakespeare's hugely promising Knives label debut the hyper-lucid constructs of J.G. Biberkopf with 'Ecologies', housed in suitably striking artwork by Joe Hamilton. Hailing from Lithuania, Jacques Gaspard Biberkopf has hatched a dramatic and immersive aesthetic, drawing upon cutting edge instrumental grime, net phenomenology and cyber-ambient sound design to patch collaged spheres working across club, theatre and digital radio contexts."
37,Sophie,Product,Electronic,"SOPHIE presents one of 2015's defining records with the immaculate electro-pop of 'Product'. Since emerging with a flash remix of Auntie Flo's 'Highlife' in 2012, SOPHIE has infused a minty fresh digital air to modern pop music with a procession of stunning solo singles, co-productions for PC Music's QT, and production credits for Japan's queen of J-pop, Namie Amuro, Mad Decent's LIZ and erm, songwriting for Madonna's 'Bitch I'm Madonna' alongside Ariel Pink."
38,Bj Nilsen + Sigtryggur Berg Sigmarsson,Avantgardegasse,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"**Edition of 200 with sticker and hand-numbered insert by Dennis Tyfus** This is brilliant!! For Belgium's peerless Ultra Eczema, BJ Nilsen & Sigtryggur Berg Sigmarsson present their first duo LP of cut-up concrète and electro-acoustic junctures. They're well known to us lot at least for their amazing records together with Helgi Thorsson as BJNilsen and Stillupsteypa - check 'Space Finale'!"
39,,,Unknown,No review available
40,Ron Morelli,A Gathering Together,Electronic,"Ron Morelli returns to Hospital Productions with a 2nd album of stare-down noise and gut-scraped techno fundamentals; a surreal and febrile series of grotesques wrenched from Pro-One metal synths, scrap percussion and a burned-out mind to emulate and celebrate the sensation of dry sweat, post-club vertigo and the numbing gratification of sensorial excess."
41,Loke Rahbek And Puce Mary,The Female Form,Industrial / Wave / Electro,"Two of Copenhagen's most virulent collaborators meet again in this coarsely textured and visceral tribute to 'The Female Form'. Both long-serving members of the Posh Isolation posse, Loke Rahbek (Croatian Amor, Damien Dubrovnik, Lust For Youth) and Frederikke Hoffmeier a.k.a. Puce Mary have orbited each other for years, and were previously coupled up on 'The Closed Room' (2011), the first in a trilogy of collaborations, this being their 2nd."
42,Elysia Crampton,American Drift,Electronic,"'American Drift' is the uniquely incisive and beguiling solo debut LP by Bolivian-American artist Elysia Crampton (f.k.a. E+E). It follows her 'Moth / Lake' 7"" on Boomkat Editions to mark the 2nd issue in her ongoing Shenandoah series - ""a concept study that follows Virginian American history, exploring brownness as more than culture or Othering, as geology. As mud, dirt and mineral, enmeshed in lithic, vast time scales."
43,Clay Rendering,Snowthorn,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"Perhaps the most compelling of all the many projects started by one-time members of Wolf Eyes, Clay Rendering came to life in 2013 by Mike Connelly and his wife, Tara, and have since released a trio of singles for Hospital Productions that have gained them the admiration of followers spanning both electronic and metal communities. For their long-awaited debut album they mount a majestically forlorn soundtrip weaving black metal-tainted dream-pop with neo-folk and gothic ambience."
44,Rustie,EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE,Electronic,"YES Rustie! After two albums of intensely hypercoloured bucky funk, the Glaswegian prodigy ratchets his sound with breathtaking, textured dynamics more akin to TCF or Lorenzo Senni in his stunning 3rd album 'EVENIFUDONTBELIEVE'. A vertiginous experience in headphones, the club, or the megadome, it turns up everything that was already good about his sound to a red-lining biting point right on the cusp of gangsta-rolling groove control and ultimate raver chaos."
45,Wolf Eyes,I Am A Problem: Mind In Pieces,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"After 18 years in the game the indomitable Wolf Eyes rove onto Jack White's Third Man Records with the stout admission, 'I Am A Problem: Mind In Pieces' arriving a coupla circles 'round the sun since 2013's primordial 'No Answer-Lower Floors' LP."
46,The Necks,Vertigo,Modern Classical / Ambient,"The Necks 18th album Vertigo is an eventful, kaleidoscopic tone poem set against a darkly shimmering background. Slowly but inexorably moving forward, it crosses many frontiers yet remains true to the mission and mood established in the opening stanzas of this cinematic 44 minute journey. A work able to be viewed either as a whole, or two symmetrical halves, Vertigo sees The Necks once again offer an excursion in sound that reflects both the light and darkness of some preternatural world."
47,Levon Vincent,Levon Vincent,Techno / House,"*Very Limited Restock* The eagle has definitely landed, all 4 x 12""s of it, replete with bespoke artwork! Marking the highlight of many house heads' calendar, Berlin-based NYC transplant Levon Vincent yields a debut album of eleven heavy house signatures brimming with techno soul. The man really needs little introduction - he's behind some of the most sought-after club tracks of the last decade - so we'll cut to the chase… it's ace!"
48,"Jac Berrocal, David Fenech & Vincent Epplay",Antigravity,Electronic,"'Antigravity' is a sui generis invocation of the rarest, compelling order coaxed from the French avant-garde by Blackest Ever Black. Around the locus of cult trumpeter Jac Berrocal - who famously appeared in the NWW list and collaborated with Steven Stapleton - David Fenech and Vincent Epplay unfold a deliciously psychedelic mystery steeped in the esoteric traditions of musique concrète, dub and jazz, and played with a DIY post-punk freedom."
49,Mike Cooper,Fratello Mare,Electronic,"*Beautiful new album from Mike Cooper, out now via Room 40* Mike Cooper returns with another wondrous album bringing together his unique lap steel playing with stylistic influences that frame him somewhere between the exotica of Martin Denny, the modulated electronic-jazz of Move D’s Conjoint, and Alice Coltrane’s spiritual evocations."
50,Akira Rabelais,The Little Glass,Modern Classical / Ambient,"Akira Rabelais has long been in our list of the most interesting, overlooked producers in electronic music. His early material for Mille Plateaux offshoot Ritornell was nothing short of revelatory, a mysterious, complex maze of elaborate layering that genuinely sounded unlike any of his contemporaries, or anything we've heard since."
51,Stephen O'Malley,Eternelle Idole,Modern Classical / Ambient,"Effectively Stephen O'Malley-on-ice, 'Eternelle Idole' is the Sunn 0))) agent of doom's debut composition for ice-skating choreography. His score for Gisèle Vienne's eponymous piece sparingly spreads 47 minutes of modular synth, guitar, clavichord, piano keys and vocal over 3 sides of 2 discs - the 3rd side is mysteriously left blank - accompanied by familiar collaborators, Steve Moore, Daniel O'Sullivan, Peter Rehberg, Jesse Sykes, Bill Herzog and Randall Dunn."
52,Laurel Halo,In Situ,Electronic,Laurel Halo stakes an eagerly and widely awaited return with the beguiling 4.1 world techno dimensions of 'In Situ' for Honest Jon's after cutting her teeth with highly acclaimed albums and EPs for Hippos In Tanks (R.I.P.) and Hyperdub.
53,Nadia Khan,Open Interior,Electronic,"Sublime, introspective ambient from a new artist presented by Brighton's superlative Where To Now label. According to the artist, Nadia Khan; ""Open Interior explores feelings of loneliness and anxiety. It is a sense of disconnection to the outside world. My intent was to form a mixture of light and heavy sounds that reflect these emotions."
54,Retribution Body,Aokigahara,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"Type suck us in head first with Retribution Body's blooming black mass of acoustic drone alchemy, 'Aokigahara'. Known to his pals and employers at Boston's Berklee College as world class acoustic technician Matthew Azevedo, Retribution Body is the very occasional moniker for his musical exploits, revealing a rarified grasp of low end frequency manipulation on a par with the likes of Earth, Sunn 0))) or Phill Niblock."
55,Lotic,Heterocetera,Grime / Fwd,"Janus resident Lotic fracks the future with five expansive club visions in 'Heterocetera', his first vinyl release and debut for Tri Angle. Finding and opening fissures of possibility in the facade and body of current club music, his unique approach to meter, space and tone results a genuinely affective impact: it challenges the way we dance; probes and teases our pleasure centre's tolerance for off-kilter, oily tones and soured timbre."
56,Alva Noto,Xerrox (Vol. 3),Modern Classical / Ambient,"Alva Noto beautifully exchanges austerity for cinematographic lushness with the remarkably widescreen 3rd volume in his 'Xerrox' series. Inspired by private, formative influences such as 'La Isla Misteriosa y el Capitán' - based on Jules Verne's 'The Mysterious Island' - and Tarvosky's screen adaptation of 'Solaris', he uses the self-designed Xerrox software to transpose early, ingenuous feelings of awe and wonder into innovative, intimate atmospheres and dynamic soundscapes."
57,Grimes,Art Angels,Electronic,"Grimes holds a liquid mirror to the gurning fizzog of pop music with 'Art Angels', her 2nd album for 4AD. Entirely written, composed and produced by the mercurial Canadian, it's one of the most canny, addictive pop records you'll hear this year."
58,Kamasi Washington,The Epic,Jazz / Fusion,"The Epic is a 172-minute, three-volume set that includes a 32-piece orchestra, a 20-person choir, and 17 songs overlaid with a compositional score written by Washington.  ""Pulsing underneath is an otherworldly ten-piece band, each member of which is individually regarded as among the best young musicians on the planet – including bassist Thundercat and his brother, drummer Ronald Bruner Jr."
59,Zenker Brothers,Immersion,Techno / House,"Masterful debut album of infected techno from the Brothers Zenker on their excellent Ilian Tape imprint. Detailed with exquisitely gruff production values to bite in all the right places, 'Immersion' cycles ten cuts of roiling techno hydraulicks and breakbeat rolige nipped and tucked at acute angles for those who really like to get into a groove, not just stand there and ""appreciate"" it."
60,Black Mecha,AA,Electronic,"The Death of Rave is proud to host the initiation of Black Mecha, a new project authorised by Fortress Crookedjaw ov WOLD, introducing a sci-fi vision of heavy electronics strongly informed by the outer limits of black metal and a cryptic, esoteric weltanschuuang."
61,,,Unknown,No review available
62,Colin Stetson & Sarah Neufeld,Never Were the Way She Was,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"Two of Constellation's acclaimed solo instrumental artists join forces on this tremendous album of original compositions for horn and violin. ""Stetson and Neufeld first began playing in duo formation while on tour together as soloists in 2012, joining each other on stage for one or two of their respective pieces."
63,King Midas Sound / Fennesz,Edition 1,Electronic,"Kevin Martin and co's King Midas Sound enlist Christian Fennesz to initiate a promising four-part collaboration series. 'Edition 1' indulges' KMS's love of shoegaze, dub and textured drone dynamics across a wide-scoped 1 hour suite, also included in killer instrumental mixes that work beautifully in their own right."
64,William Basinski,Cascade,Modern Classical / Ambient,"William Basinski returns with 'Cascade' - a gorgeous 40 minute meditation on a solitary piano loop coaxed by NYC's neoclassical maestro, William Basinski.  Teechnically, that's all you really need to know, but we should stress that Basinski's way with a loop transcends any prosaic, earthly description and manifests a music in its own self-sufficient world of infinitely morphing harmonics and decay as imperceptibly slow moving yet ever-changing as life itself."
65,Heather Leigh,I Abused Animal,Folk / Roots,"Eminent producer of the far leftfield captured in flight by Stephen O'Malley's Ideologic Organ. RIYL Richard Youngs, Charalambides, raw Kiwi rock music ""'I Abused Animal' is Heather Leigh's first proper solo studio album after solo releases on labels Golden Lab, Not Not Fun, Fag Tapes, Wish Image and Volcanic Tongue."
66,Fis,The Blue Quicksand Is Going Now,Electronic,"'The Blue Quicksand Is Going Now' is the debut album by Oliver Perryman a.k.a. FIS.  In pursuit of a sound ecology reflecting the complex dynamics of nature thru electronic music, FIS' un-quantised, texturally abstract compositions have practically ripped the rug from beneath the feet of D&B, techno and ambient music to leave them spinning in gyroscopic hyperspace. Now, after a series of cultishly acclaimed singles for Samurai Horo, Exit and Tri Angle, a.o."
67,Sam Prekop,The Republic,Electronic,"Regardless of the style he is working in, Sam Prekop’s music is always imbued with a sense of wide-eyed discovery and exploration. As the singer and guitarist of The Sea And Cake, Prekop has incorporated elements of traditional styles from around the world, expanding the public perception of what it means to be the leader of a pop band."
68,Flying Saucer Attack,Instrumentals 2015,Indie / Alternative,"Original Bristol shoegazer, Flying Saucer Attack, completes a quietly breathtaking return with his first new album in 15 years. Where all too often this sort of return can simply reprise an old sound for diehard fans, 'Instrumentals 2015' is a timeless and otherworldly recording with a radiant, transcendent appeal for anyone with a taste for blown-out guitar drone scapes."
69,Dj Richard,Grind,Techno / House,"White Material's Berlin-based co-founder DJ Richard serves a smart debut album of low-slung, shadowy house on Hamburg's Dial imprint. The follow-up to his early WM 12""'s and remixes for Radioslave and Dan Bodan takes inspiration from those odd spaces between nature and manmade landscapes and works quite a few shades darker than the usual Dial sound whilst neatly fitting in with their low-key and mesmerising aesthetic."
70,Shit & Shine,Everybody's a Fuckin Expert,Techno / House,"Filthy dirty Wreck 'N Roll manoeuvres from Shit & Shine, romping loose on Editions Mego. In Craig Clouse's 3rd album in this guise of 2015 his voracious appetite for fugged-up noise and terminated techno-funk is barely harnessed in 12 buck wild parts razzing out from shredded breakbeat blisters of 'Signal Failure' thru the nine minutes of roto-techno jack in 'Wespennest' to the hard-stepping diamond, 'Working On My Fitness' and rapid-fire flurries of bit-crushed drums in 'Ass'."
71,Helen,The Original Faces,Indie / Alternative,"Portland's Liz Harris (Grouper), Scott Simmons and Jed Bindeman (Eternal Tapestry) clear the pop air with a brace of raw, blown-out fuzz-pop paeans under the Helen mantle. After debuting the Helen sound with a 7"" on Yellow Electric in 2013, they rustle up an eleven track album nodding as much to early Creation Records as much as Flying Nun's '80s Kiwi distorto-pop thistles and reverb-drenched '60s garage."
72,Saturn & The Sun,Journey To The Center Of Your Mind,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"*Joachim Nordwall and Henrik Rylander return with this incredibly heavy drone-noise session under the 'Saturn and the Sun’ moniker* Crushing, celestial sized drone objects from Nordwall and Rylander here, sheathed in absorbing artwork by Martin Jacobsen. 'Journey to the Center of Your Mind' projects three concentrated, irradiating beams of Scandinavian drone noise intensity recorded at Studio Dental, Gothenburg."
73,Ian William Craig,Cradle for the Wanting,Electronic,"Quietly gorgeous, distorted hymns, entirely created with vocals and personalised tape loop system. Imagine a sombre Juliana Barwick with a strong taste for the tempered majesty of GY!BE and filtered by Basinski. Includes a 12"" x 24"" dual-sided colour insert and download code. Edition of 700 ""Cradle for the Wanting is the anticipated second album by vocalist Ian William Craig."
74,Peder Mannerfelt,The Swedish Congo Record,Electronic,"**Adroit electronic reconstructions of ""original 1930s field recordings"" made in the Then Belgian Congo** ""Peder Mannerfelt’s release for Archives Intérieures takes us back to Belgian Congo in the 1930's. This adventurous album finds its roots in a very obscure 78 rpm record, put together by Belgian filmmaker Armand Denis, who was one of the first Europeans to capture the incredible sounds of Central Congo. These recordings were published in 1950 as The Belgian Congo Records."
75,Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe & Ariel Kalma,FRKWYS Vol. 12: We Know Each Other Somehow,Modern Classical / Ambient,"The FRKWYS series has a tendency to turn out some really inspired unions, and this ranks among their best. Recorded just outside of Mullimbimby, a remote community on the eastern Australian coast, it marks a pineal, inter-generational journey aligning Kalma's naturalist tendency and invaluable background working at the GRM with Lowe's malleable modular synth visions."
76,Suzanne Kraft,Talk from Home,Electronic,"Dusky, wistful downstrokes from a dude in disguise, Diego Herrera a.k.a. Suzanne Kraft. Breezing in on Jonny Nash's melody As Truth label, 'Talk From Home' renders a beautifully intimate and melancholic vibe in seven lolling pieces showcasing the L.A.-based Kraft's tender blue side, as opposed to his mid-tempo chug-offs on Running Back, or deep house as Dude Energy."
77,Hieroglyphic Being & J.I.T.U Ahn-Sahm-Buhl,We Are Not The First,Techno / House,"At the behest of RVNG Intl. Hieroglyphic Being channels his music thru a stellar Ahn-Sahm-Buhl of players/fellow aliens including Arkestra leader Marshall Allen, operatic vocalist Shelley Hirsch, and electronic explorer Ben Vida, a.o., for the enlightened realisation of 'We Are Not The First'. Effectively it finds Jamal Moss, a.k.a. Hieroglyphic Being, and his music, taken out of the box and into the realm of instrumental vibrations and telepathic communication."
78,Shuttle 358,Can you prove I was born,Modern Classical / Ambient,"**The long awaited, sublime new album from Shuttle 358 finally surfaces. Ten years on from his gorgeous and much-loved 'Chessa', Dan Abrams mixes more melancholy, enchanted and even caustic elements into gauzily nostalgic scapes. A massive recommendation if you're into classic Eno & Budd, Wolfgang Voigt’s Gas, Kreng, Fennesz, BoC or Stephan Mathieu** ""With the days of synthetic minimalism fading beyond the horizon in our rear view mirror, we pick up where Chessa (12k1030) left off."
79,Rp Boo,"Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints",Jungle / Footwork,"RP Boo, the OG source of all things Chicago footwork, comes correct with a killer 2nd solo album for Planet Mu. 'Fingers, Bank Pads & Shoe Prints' is an armoury of battle trax for the 'floor, delivered with a conviction and density of energy that's impossible to ignore if you're into electronic dance music or the lineage of Afro-American sonics."
80,Sightings,Amusers and Puzzlers,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"'Amusers & Puzzlers' is the incendiary kiss-off from NYC's lean, muscular noise rock unit, Sightings. After 15 years entrenched in the city's underground, and following a successful European tour and ninth album, 'Terribly Well', they disbanded in 2014, leaving us with this final document of their adroit capabilities when it comes to jackhammer noise and unorthodox axe mangling."
81,Moritz Von Oswald Trio,Sounding Lines,Electronic,"Moritz Von Oswald conducts a cabinet reshuffle, exchanging Vladislav Delay for legendary Afrobeat percussionist Tony Allen on his superb fourth Trio album and follow-up to 'Borderland' with Juan Atkins. Alongside original member Max Loderbauer, the trio embark on a new and deeply charming chapter of elemental rhythm and sound exploration, positioning them ever closer to some modern day version of the Gruppo Di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza."
82,Simbiosi,Elements,Electronic,"Simbiosi skin the 'floor to life with an uncanny and uncompromising debut album of noisy tech for Werkdiscs / Ninja Tune after appearing in their label boss Actress' DJ-Kicks mix. Where too many producers pass off a lunk-headed lack of funk with paste-on noize,  Italian duo Simbiosi are symptomatic of an Italian new wave who appreciate the need for nuance, oddness and dynamic within their personal brand of raw-ass brutality."
83,I-Lp-O In Dub (Ilpo Väisänen),Communist Dub,Electronic,"Hell just froze over: Pan Sonic's lesser-spotted Ilpo Väisänen finally returns with a solo album of industro-dub rhythms recalling his little-known but killer output as Liima and Piiri. It's all new material, stringently focussed on the bare-bones dynamics of Jamaican dub proper but, filtered with the precise, austere approach of Pan Sonic as a ""statement against technocracy and the erosion of human community."
84,Kreng,The Summoner,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"We’ve been waiting for this one for a while - one of the most talented and overlooked composers in the death-ambient/invisible soundtrack realm finally returns with a petrifying suite of doom-laced string compositions on this excellent new album for Miasmah; 'The Summoner'. In the course of three albums and handful of shortform releases, Pepijn Caudron has become a byword for Bosch-like visions of a soundtrack-quality calibre."

86,Nozinja,Nozinja Lodge,World,"Jaw-dropping debut solo album from Nozinja, the brains behind South Africa's maddest export - Shangaan Electro."
87,Low Jack,Sewing Machine,Techno / House,The nastiest cat in Paris rips the head off it with eight tracks of rabid noise tek for In Paradisum.
88,Björk,Vulnicura,Electronic,"Björk comes to terms with the breakdown of a longterm relationship with some help from Arca, The Haxan Cloak, Antony and Spaces.  It's arguably her most coherent and focused album since 'Vespertine' (2001), her vocals incredibly raw and emotional - understandably in the light of tragic, personal events - yet controlled with near operatic poise and matched by the waking-dream-like qualities of the production's skewed meter and tendencies toward keening, lushly expressive discord."
89,Sam Kidel,Untitled (Movements),Electronic,"**Limited Edition pressing of 200 copies from Sam Kidel, aka El Kid and a member of Killing Sound and Young Echo**  Sam Kidel a.k.a. El Kid presents an extended drone work for the excellent Entr’acte label inspired by Henri Michaux's 'Untitled (Movements)' drawing."
90,Lightning Bolt,Fantasy Empire,Dark Ambient / Drone / Metal,"""Fantasy Empire, Lightning Bolt’s sixth album and first in five years, is a fresh take from a band intent on pushing themselves musically and sonically while maintaining the aesthetic that has defined not only them, but an entire generation of noisemakers. It marks many firsts, most notably their first recordings made using hi-fi recording equipment at the famed Machines With Magnets, and their first album for Thrill Jockey."
91,Bossa Luce,Nel Salotto Degli Appestati,Industrial / Wave / Electro,"Vereker's Endangered Species rack up a necessary survey of Bossa Luce's possessed Italian post punk/EBM voodoo with 10 bleedin' cuts drawn from his dead limited, privately issued early tapes.  Dank, destroyed, devious, devilish; all words that alliterate with and sum up Bossa Luce's barrelling and headstrong sound, sprung from a heady mixture of inspirations from the demented atmospheres of Maurizio Bianchi to knackered dub techniques and Belgian EBM backbone."
92,Florian Hecker & Mark Leckey,Hecker Leckey Sound Voice Chimera,Extreme / Noise / Computer Music,"'Hecker Leckey Sound Voice Chimera' presents a radical mashup of works by two probing, multidisciplinary artists among the most vital of their generation."
93,Phil Collins,My Heart’s In My Hand...,Electronic,"Strictly Limited Copies - Includes new and specially-comissioned music by Demdike Stare, Lætitia Sadier, David Sylvian, Pye Corner Audio, Maria Minerva, Peaking Lights and many more."
94,Mika Vainio & Vigroux,"Peau froide, léger soleil",Electronic,"Sheathed in some of the best album artwork of 2015, Mika Vainio and Franck Vigroux reveal the buzzing and psyched-out electronic sculptures of 'Peau froide, léger soleil' on Shapednoise's Cosmo Rhythmatic label."
95,Lifted,1,Electronic,"Lifted is a stellar new project sparked off by Matthew Papich (Co La) and Future Times overlord Max D for PAN. Realised and rendered together with Jordan GCZ and Gigi Masin, among others, their debut LP '1' is an elegant exercise in breaking free of the grid, consolidating a spectrum of congruent ideas and idiosyncratic styles with a beautifully communal spirit putting a contemporary spin on the freedoms of '70s jazz fusion."
96,Andrea Taeggi,Mama Matrix Most Mysterious,Electronic,"Type return with Andrea Taeggi's probing and propulsive modular session 'Mama Matrix Most Mysterious', recorded on the Buchla and Serge systems at Sweden's EMS facility. Marking a considered step away from the rugged tonalities of Taeggi's solo work as Gondwana, or in the Lumisokea duo with Koenraad Ecker, the Italian artist gets to grips with EMS' coveted gear across six tense and icy transmissions clearly in thrall to the machines' capacity for making unique timbres and rhythms."
97,Dj Paypal,Sold Out,Jungle / Footwork,"Fresh footwork trans-action from your boy DJ Paypal on LA's Brainfeeder, for your health. The sample-happy producer beloved of Kode 9 of LuckyMe goes loose and wild with eight tracks including three collaborations with Chicago's Teklife crew."
98,Jim O'Rourke,Simple Songs,Indie / Alternative,"Jim O’Rourke is ready to talk to you again with his first pop album since 2001.  ""Simple Songs’ is an amazing record of musical song entertainment because Jim O’Rourke knows what he wants and how to get it. The range of sounds and songs that have turned Jim’s head are numerous enough to have crushed together into something that is unmistakably his. The music is played so immaculately by so many instruments and most of them by the creator’s hand."
99,Oren Ambarchi,Live Knots,Electronic,"'Live Knots' presents two immersive live recordings of Oren Ambarchi playing the epic 'Knots' from 'Audience Of One' (Touch, 2012) in Tokyo and Krakow's Unsound Festival.  Captured with alternately intimate and widescreen fidelity, the original elements of cyclonic guitar harmony and quicksilver percussion are twisted different ways across the two performances, exploring and testing every nuance of the track's framework."
100,Mittland Och Leo,Optimists,Industrial / Wave / Electro,"This is so good! 'Optimists' is the enchanting debut album of rustling drum machines and diaphanous, bittersweet synth lines by Joke Desmet and Milan Warmoeskerken, aka Mittland och Leo. Equal parts Broadcast-like twee exotica and Suicide-style motorik funk, it also holds up very neatly next to like-minded missions from Not Waving, Moon Wheel or early, ambient AFX, hitting the sweetspot of smart simplicity with every turn."
