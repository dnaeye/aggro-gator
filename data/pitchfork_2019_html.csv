1,Lana Del Rey,Norman Fucking Rockwell!,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell/,"After eight years, five albums, and complete political and cultural upheaval, Lana Del Rey has risen to her greatest musical heights. When she first crash-landed into the public consciousness in 2011, breathily cooing about video games and blue jeans, the artist formerly known as Lizzy Grant was engulfed in heated debates over her authenticity, whether or not she was in control of her creative output, and whether she deserved her success at all.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5XpEKORZ4y6OrCZSKsi46A"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
2,FKA twigs,MAGDALENE,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fka-twigs-magdalene/,"FKA twigs’ second album plays like an unsparing breakup manual for a distant species, some glamorous alien race presumably as brilliant at everything as she is: singing, producing, writing, dancing, seducing, exorcising, empathizing. MAGDALENE is an overwhelming collection of intimacies, a generous feat of communication that turns her specific pain (not all of us have to get over a breakup with a celluloid vampire) into communion.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3DMR3yM5crnt1dG9lLaMTZ"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

U.F.O.F, the first of two stellar albums the band released this year, sounds at once exploratory and wise, as if they are both seeing the world with fresh wonder while explaining the way things have always been.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0sLnNGW4PzCYFQ4Pn7aVCP"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

Her most dramatic release yet, All Mirrors telegraphs to us in Andrew Lloyd Webber-sized gestures: When Olsen's voice ascends an octave on “Lark,” the accompanying drum resounds like a cannon aimed at a fortress, and the dive-bombing glissandos from the orchestra mimic debris streaming around her.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0RedX0LZkGUFoRwFntAaI0"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

The singer’s fourth album, When I Get Home, is a collection of reveries on family, history, and blackness—a love letter to her hometown. She finds solace in the frequent repetition of phrases and calls on powerful forebears for guidance, be they Alice Coltrane, Steve Reich, or DJ Screw.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4WF4HvVT7VjGnVjxjoCR6w"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

It’s not the field recordings that populate interludes like “November 7.” Nor is it the album’s introspective closer, “My Name Is for My Friends,” which splices ambient sounds with brief, cryptic dialogue.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/17LsQV3q3cgTBrat3D5JSv"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

On her fourth album as Weyes Blood, L.A. singer-songwriter Natalie Mering coos laughably old-fashioned lines like “treat me right, I’m still a good man’s daughter” while referencing the cosmic loneliness of modern dating. You can parse out the weight, hope, and humor of Mering’s poetry, or you can sit back and let her dulcet tone and excellent taste in George Harrison-esque slide guitar wash over you.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0Cuqhgy8vm96JEkBY3polk"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

LEGACY!, her sophomore album.

While there’s no song explicitly about her on Jaime, there is urgent advice about how to live with the time we’re given: by refusing hatred and spreading love in fractious times; by dismissing inattentive partners and acting on desire. That immediacy pervades the sound of Howard’s solo debut, which is less wedded to genre than her work with Alabama Shakes and Thunderbitch.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6fbphjr9j57oxMB2bnhzUf"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

But not five months later came Two Hands, which is as much an exorcism as its predecessor. Violence ripples through these songs like a vein of quartz—“Rock and Sing” might be a children’s lullaby about lost souls, “The Toy” an intimation of great evil.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5pp7px9MITK2MqeFVbRWGo"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

Homecoming: The Live Album—the musical companion to her retina-popping Coachella live film—boasts a whopping 40 tracks that fuse soul, hip-hop, gospel, and go-go with live skits and confessional interludes, as brassy marching bands and black drumlines give dap to the cultural traditions of HBCUs.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/35S1JCj5paIfElT2GODl6x"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

While Callahan’s double album Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest contains plenty of his signature wisdom—songs about love and death, paternal advice and domestic romance, smirking one-liners and piercing, plainspoken verse—its magic is in the way his words wear his music like a beloved pair of old jeans.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/59hAqiqCmbfLBDtMzGCNpp"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
16,Bon Iver,"i,i",https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bon-iver-ii/,"In form and function, Bon Iver’s fourth album is an act of protest. You can see its vision of egalitarianism across the LP’s inner gatefold, which shows obscured portraits of the 52 people who helped create the record. You can hear its selflessness in the myriad tones, instruments, voices, and happy accidents that come and go, subverting ego while sidestepping excess. Even the title i,i nods to the Rastafarian idea of “I and I,” of oneness.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1JlvIsP2f6ckoa62aN7kLn"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

18,Clairo,Immunity,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clairo-immunity/,"The solitary piano chords that launch Clairo’s debut album sum up the emotional tone of everything to come. Opener “Alewife” finds 21-year-old singer-songwriter Claire Cottrill revisiting suicidal thoughts that she had in eighth grade, and over the next 10 tracks, we are with her through so many growing pains and regrets. Even on the twinkling “Impossible,” where she evokes how weird and cool it is to be a young person with a messy, meaningful life ahead, she never hides.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4kkVGtCqE2NiAKosri9Rnd"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

For kids raised under the threat of mass extinction, of course a dead-eyed 17-year-old whispering about night terrors, benzos, suicide, and the climate crisis over a post-genre stew of trap beats, dubstep drops, and twee-ish bedroom pop would be hailed as a savior.

Sometimes those two things complement each other nicely; sometimes they don’t. But rarely do they melt into each other in the way they do on MIKE’s Tears of Joy.

But Remind Me Tomorrow cracks her style open like a geode: The roadhouse soul of “You Shadow” is halfway between Motown and Massive Attack; “Seventeen” arrives decades too late for the John Hughes closing credits it deserves; “Jupiter 4,” titled after a vintage Roland synthesizer, sounds like a gothic take on slowcore.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2dvXk4nacVRmDSnbKniwrS"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

She’s still calling out irritating shit, but with a cool-headed poise.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5JbeU5WL1WAGxy1u5fsOmf"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
44,Holly Herndon,PROTO,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/holly-herndon-proto/,"PROTO plays like a document of the creation of Spawn, the neural network that experimentalist Holly Herndon trained to sing using her voice alongside the voices of some 300 collaborators. But Spawn isn’t a computer simulation made to appear human, like other recent CGI novelties. According to Herndon, who recently earned her PhD in artificial intelligence in music, Spawn learns on “her” own, and Herndon uses the technology to create an album that thrills even beyond its futuristic context.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/29sozE8XDMOHT8KK9iq4Fo"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
45,DaBaby,Baby on Baby,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dababy-baby-on-baby/,"On his major label debut, North Carolina rapper DaBaby is tireless behind the mic, weaving words with a boxer’s nimble intensity. Utterly smashed 808s and snappy drums undergird his flows as he injects fierce energy into hits like “Suge” and “Baby Sitter.” He has range beyond the singles, too: “Carpet Burn” finds him twirling around hedonistic reflections on his success, while “Deal Wit It” and “Backend” flash his melodic finesse.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/623PL2MBg50Br5dLXC9E9e"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
46,Chai,PUNK,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chai-punk/,"PUNK, the second album from Nagoya, Japan’s Chai, is as anthemic and glossy as it is insurgent. Throughout the record, the quartet subtly distort their sugar-pie group vocals, whisking them into frenzied disco-grrl guitars, hectic brass bleats, and fluorescent electro blips. They pierce the conformist pressures of contemporary Asian femininity without clichès or sloganeering: “Too much makeup/Just lips and eyebrows all set,” chirps frontwoman Mana in Japanese.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7tcbI0Qp64LaGwHYgwkbBO"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
47,Barker,Utility,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/barker-utility/,"Sam Barker is wary of taking the easy route in getting people to move their bodies. A resident DJ at Berlin’s hallowed techno haven Berghain, he has voiced his skepticism of kick drums and drops—the utilitarian elements that so often trigger lizard-brain reactions on a dancefloor. For his debut album, Utility, Barker dug into his archives to see which of his old sketches sounded good when he stripped them back to the studs. The result is mysterious, weightless.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5F3YJdIjGHhnUVuD96G1mz"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
48,Danny Brown,uknowhatimsayin¿,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/danny-brown-uknowhatimsayin/,"Danny Brown’s fifth full-length offers heartening proof that the 38-year-old has settled snugly into a demographic of middle-class rappers who can sustain livelihoods without the pressure of storming charts or selling out stadiums. The album is a wonderful scenario for an artist a decade into their career: a rewarding balance of consistency and growth, with subtle experimentation instead of the common midcareer misstep of transparently grabbing for radio play.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4G3BRVsGEpWzUdplFJ1VBl"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"

50,Floating Points,Crush,https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/floating-points-crush/,"British electronic producer Sam Shepherd has always exerted remarkable control over his meticulous musical output as Floating Points: With his favored instrument, the Buchla modular synthesizer, he can contour sound waves and alter circuitry to suit his needs. But Shepherd, like the rest of us, has comparatively little control over his input, and the chaos of the past three years—Brexit, Trump—shook something loose inside him.","<iframe src=""https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1WwZwdTICfaZI51BIIEN9z"" width=""300"" height=""80"" frameborder=""0"" allowtransparency=""true"" allow=""encrypted-media""></iframe>"
