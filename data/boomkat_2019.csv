1,Kali Malone,The Sacrificial Code,Modern Classical / Ambient,https://boomkat.com/products/the-sacrificial-code,"Our album of the year 2019 is Kali Malone’s 'The Sacrificial Code’ -  a major work featuring almost two hours of concentrated, creeping organ pieces. 'The Sacrificial Code' provided us with precious mental refuge just as the world started to spin out of control around us. It's an album that somehow slowed everything down, allowing us to take notice of every slight movement, as if every minute shift in sound became magnified through stillness."
2,Jim O'Rourke,To Magnetize Money And Catch A Roving Eye,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/to-magnetize-money-and-catch-a-roving-eye,"Sonic shapeshifter Jim O’Rourke yields 4 hours of engrossing, kaleidoscopic recordings from the Steamroom circa 2017-2018 in one of his most significant outings for years.

Dawid recorded, overdubbed and mixed the album on her own after a brain tumor diagnosis disrupted her music studies, she plays every instrument you hear (except for some drums), appears on the cover and produced every flawless twist and turn you’ll find inside."
5,Morton Feldman,Morton Feldman Piano,Modern Classical / Ambient,https://boomkat.com/products/morton-feldman-piano,"‘Morton Feldman Piano’ is a major 5CD collection of virtually all of Feldman’s music for piano, performed by Philip Thomas with a tactility befitting of this extraordinary, quiet, intimate music. It’s the most extensive survey of Feldman’s piano music since John Tilbury’s long unavailable 4-CD set was released 20 years ago, including several pieces which weren’t included there, and three works which have never been released on disc before at all."

9,Laura Cannell & Polly Wright,Sing As The Crow Flies,Modern Classical / Ambient,https://boomkat.com/products/sing-as-the-crow-flies,"Tapping a sublime vein of purely vocal improv inspired by local landscape, history and people, Norfolk’s Laura Cannell and Polly Wright quietly blow us away with their debut collaboration. Remarkably conceived, recorded and released in 2019 - the same year they first met - ‘Sing as the Crow Flies’ is a super-natural meeting of mutual souls seeking to limn a sort of deep topographical reading of their home turf in a series of haunting, near-wordless hymns."
10,Kim Gordon,No Home Record,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/no-home-record,"Brilliantly loose-limbed, inspirational solo debut album from Kim Gordon after four decades fronting myriad projects, most notably Sonic Youth, but also with numerous collaborators including Tony Conrad, Ikue Mori, Julie Cafritz, Stephen Malkmus and most recently with Bill Nace as one half of Body/Head."
11,Klein,Lifetime,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/lifetime-3ca1a574-38c1-4dea-b259-90657947b6a2,"‘Lifetime’ is the debut album proper by visionary collagist/producer/vocalist Klein, following from 2016’s head-spinning introduction made with ‘Only’. Recorded by Klein over the past 18 months and issued on her own label, inj inc., the album renders her mosaic of ideas taken from Gospel composer James Cleveland to film pioneer Spencer Williams and 18th C. tonalities in dreamlike 3D, and elevates her form of abstract, contemporary spirituality to quietly jaw-slapping degrees."
12,...,No Title,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/no-title-04aeabc2-a97d-4e85-a75f-a84a4cc215b4,"Sähkö are keeping schtum about this ace enigma from “an experimental artist willing to stay anonymous on this project”, although they do mention a likeness to Nurse With Wound, Hafler Trio, Zoviet*France… Presented under the low key moniker, …, ‘No Title’ sounds like a night in an abandoned wooden cabin in the arctic circle with CM Von Hausswolff, and only a reel to reel and a broken radio for company."
13,Jessica Pratt,Quiet Signs,Folk / Roots,https://boomkat.com/products/quiet-signs,"Jessica Pratt’s exceedingly strange, seemingly sped up but ultimately completely immersive vocals are in haunting/beguiling effect on her 3rd album following an eponymous 2012 debut and ‘On Your Own Love Again’ [Drag City, 2015].

14,Wojciech Rusin,The Funnel,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/the-funnel-ea0ba389-4dd3-4233-b30e-a35013bd21cf,"An amazing slab from Glasgow’s fecund subterrain, ‘The Funnel’ is Wojciech Rusin’s debut razz of field recordings and choral composition riddled with rug-pulling edits and keeling turns of phrases - arguably a spiritual parallel to László Hortobágyi, Black Zone Myth Chant, Jani Christou, Él-G A big clue to the cryptic chicanery of ‘The Funnel’ is the fact that Wojciech Rusin builds his own instruments, which accounts for some degree of the odd tonalities at work."
15,Leila Bordreuil,Headflush,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/headflush,"The label behind Dominique Lawalree’s much-adored compilation pick out a real abstract beauty by cellist Leila Bordreuil for their 4th release, coming off like some dream meeting of Anne Guthrie and Kevin Drumm as overseen by Eliane Radigue."

Tipped to fans of Nico, HTRK, CS + Kreme, Dome, Julee Cruise... Forming an exquisitely pruned bouquet of midnight wildflowers, ‘Look Up Sharp’ makes the shrugging pop of Carla’s debut LP ‘You Know What It’s Like’ [2016] feel almost naif by comparison."
17,H-Fusion,Captured Entities,Techno / House,https://boomkat.com/products/captured-entities,"Cult Detroit DJ/producer Howard Thomas aka H-Fusion supplies a crackshot debut album of psycho-jit-jazz and rugged raw house on The Death of Rave following his secret weapon 12”s and trax for Sound Signature, Transmat and Fit between 2005-2012."

This is his first new one in years and is quite possibly his best. Supremely beautiful music... ""As you listen to ‘Shepherd In A Sheepskin Vest’, a feeling of totality, of completeness, steals over you, like a thief in broad daylight. Of course it does - you’re listening to a new Bill Callahan record. The first one in almost six years."
19,Not Waving & Dark Mark,Downwelling,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/downwelling,"One of the year’s more unexpected collaborations, legendary singer songwriter Mark Lanegan and Ecstatic maverick Alessio Natalizia, aka Not Waving, hook up for this timeless, modernist fusion of barrel-aged narratives and diverse, experimental backdrops that reminds us of everything from Scott Walker to Conny Plank & Moebius, from Christof Kurzmann to David Sylvian."

25,Nkisi,7 Directions,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/7-directions-f8b2e3c2-bec7-4c18-95eb-a259e3652317,"Nkisi rolls out a modern classic with ‘7 Directions’ for UIQ. A masterful debut album informed by African Cosmology and Congolese rhythms, it’s aesthetically comparable with music ranging from Autechre's ‘Incunabula’ to The Connection Machine’s ‘Painless’ and Lee Gamble's hyperprisms, but ultimately it’s peerless in the (hyper)modern field..."

28,Girl Band,The Talkies,Indie / Alternative,https://boomkat.com/products/the-talkies,"One of the most inventive, well produced, original and hard-hitting records of the year. There are echoes of The Fall, Can and Sonic Youth but wrapped in something new. F#cking bravo. “In many ways the idea behind the album was to make an audio representation of the house.” And this enigmatic manor becomes Girl Band’s sonic playground: to place yourself within a space and to work with that space harmoniously."

43,Helm,Chemical Flowers,Electronic,https://boomkat.com/products/chemical-flowers,"Luke Younger yields his most engrossing work as Helm with the sorely romantic dynamics of ‘Chemical Flowers’, his follow-up to 2015’s ‘Olympic Mess’.
